# This file sets options that are appropriate for HTML output using doxygen.
# The most important such option is to actually generate HTML output.
# This file is intended to be appended to doxygen.conf.

# If the GENERATE_HTML tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# generate HTML output.

GENERATE_HTML          = YES

# The HTML_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the HTML docs will be put.
# If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be
# put in front of it. If left blank `html' will be used as the default path.

HTML_OUTPUT            = html

# The HTML_FILE_EXTENSION tag can be used to specify the file extension for
# each generated HTML page (for example: .htm,.php,.asp). If it is left blank
# doxygen will generate files with .html extension.

# The HTML_HEADER tag can be used to specify a personal HTML header for
# each generated HTML page. If it is left blank doxygen will generate a
# standard header.

# The HTML_FOOTER tag can be used to specify a personal HTML footer for
# each generated HTML page. If it is left blank doxygen will generate a
# standard footer.

HTML_FOOTER            =

# The HTML_STYLESHEET tag can be used to specify a user-defined cascading
# style sheet that is used by each HTML page. It can be used to
# fine-tune the look of the HTML output. If the tag is left blank doxygen
# will generate a default style sheet. Note that doxygen will try to copy
# the style sheet file to the HTML output directory, so don't put your own
# stylesheet in the HTML output directory as well, or it will be erased!

# If the HTML_ALIGN_MEMBERS tag is set to YES, the members of classes,

# If the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag is set to YES, additional index files

# If the GENERATE_DOCSET tag is set to YES, additional index files
# will be generated that can be used as input for Apple's Xcode 3
# integrated development environment, introduced with OSX 10.5 (Leopard).
# To create a documentation set, doxygen will generate a Makefile in the
# HTML output directory. Running make will produce the docset in that
# directory and running "make install" will install the docset in
# ~/Library/Developer/Shared/Documentation/DocSets so that Xcode will find
# it at startup.

GENERATE_DOCSET        = NO

# When GENERATE_DOCSET tag is set to YES, this tag determines the name of the
# feed. A documentation feed provides an umbrella under which multiple
# documentation sets from a single provider (such as a company or product suite)
# can be grouped.

# When GENERATE_DOCSET tag is set to YES, this tag specifies a string that

# If the HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS tag is set to YES then the generated HTML
# documentation will contain sections that can be hidden and shown after the
# page has loaded. For this to work a browser that supports

# Netscape 6.0+, Internet explorer 5.0+, Konqueror, or Safari).

HTML_DYNAMIC_SECTIONS  = NO

# If the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag is set to YES, the CHM_FILE tag can
# be used to specify the file name of the resulting .chm file. You
# can add a path in front of the file if the result should not be
# written to the html output directory.

# If the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag is set to YES, the HHC_LOCATION tag can

# the HTML help compiler on the generated index.hhp.

HHC_LOCATION           =

# If the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag is set to YES, the GENERATE_CHI flag
# controls if a separate .chi index file is generated (YES) or that
# it should be included in the master .chm file (NO).

GENERATE_CHI           = NO

# If the GENERATE_HTMLHELP tag is set to YES, the BINARY_TOC flag
# controls whether a binary table of contents is generated (YES) or a
# normal table of contents (NO) in the .chm file.

BINARY_TOC             = NO

# The TOC_EXPAND flag can be set to YES to add extra items for group members
# to the contents of the HTML help documentation and to the tree view.

TOC_EXPAND             = NO

# The DISABLE_INDEX tag can be used to turn on/off the condensed index at
# top of each HTML page. The value NO (the default) enables the index and

# If the GENERATE_TREEVIEW tag is set to YES, a side panel will be
# generated containing a tree-like index structure (just like the one that
# is generated for HTML Help). For this to work a browser that supports
# JavaScript, DHTML, CSS and frames is required (for instance Mozilla 1.0+,
# Netscape 6.0+, Internet explorer 5.0+, or Konqueror). Windows users are
# probably better off using the HTML help feature.

GENERATE_TREEVIEW      = NO

# If the treeview is enabled (see GENERATE_TREEVIEW) then this tag can be
# used to set the initial width (in pixels) of the frame in which the tree
# is shown.
