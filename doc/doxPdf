# This file sets options that are appropriate for PDF output using doxygen.
# The most important such option is to actually generate PDF output.
# This file is intended to be appended to doxygen.conf.

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES (the default) Doxygen will
# generate Latex output.

GENERATE_LATEX         = YES

# If the PDF_HYPERLINKS tag is set to YES, the LaTeX that is generated
# is prepared for conversion to pdf (using ps2pdf). The pdf file will
# contain links (just like the HTML output) instead of page references
# This makes the output suitable for online browsing using a pdf viewer.

PDF_HYPERLINKS         = YES

# If the USE_PDFLATEX tag is set to YES, pdflatex will be used instead of
# plain latex in the generated Makefile. Set this option to YES to get a
# higher quality PDF documentation.

USE_PDFLATEX           = YES

# The LATEX_OUTPUT tag is used to specify where the LaTeX docs will be put.
# If a relative path is entered the value of OUTPUT_DIRECTORY will be
# put in front of it. If left blank `latex' will be used as the default path.

LATEX_OUTPUT           = latexPdf
