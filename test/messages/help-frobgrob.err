Displaying information on action: frobgrob

Compute the Frobenius number of the passed-in Frobenius instance. This instance
must be preceded in the input by a deg-rev-lex lattice ideal Grobner basis as
produced by the program 4ti2.

The algorithm for this uses irreducible decomposition to compute the Frobenius
number, which is why this action accepts parameters related to that. See the
paper "Solving Thousand Digit Frobenius Problems Using Grobner Bases"
at www.broune.com for more details.

The parameters accepted by frobgrob are as follows.

 -bound [BOOL]   (default is on)
   Use the bound optimization to solve optimization problems faster
   by eliminating non-improving slices.

 -boundSimplify [BOOL]   (default is on)
   Use the bound optimization to solve optimization problems faster by
   simplifying slices through seeking to generate non-improving slices.
   This requires turning elimination of non-improving slices on.

 -canon [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Sort the output, including the variables, to get a canonical
   representation. This requires storing the entire output in memory, which
   can increase run time modestly and increase memory consumption greatly.

 -debug [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Print what the algorithm does at each step.

 -minimal [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Specifies that the input ideal is minimally generated by the given
   generators. Turning this on can improve performance, but if it is not
   true then Frobby may go into an infinite loop or produce incorrect results.

 -simplify [BOOL]   (default is on)
   Perform simplification when possible.

 -split STRING   (default is frob)
   The split selection strategy to use. Slice options are maxlabel, minlabel,
   varlabel, minimum, median, maximum, mingen, indep and gcd. Optimization
   computations support the specialized strategy degree as well.

 -stats [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Print statistics on what the algorithm did.

 -time [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Display and time each subcomputation.

 -vector [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Display the vector that achieves the optimal value.
