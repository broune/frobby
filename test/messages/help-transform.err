Displaying information on action: transform

By default, transform simply writes the input ideals to output. A
number of parameters allow to transform the input ideal in various ways.

The parameters accepted by transform are as follows.

 -addPurePowers [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Adds a pure power for each variable that does not already have a pure power
   in the ideal. Each exponent is chosen to be one larger than the maximal
   exponent of that variable that appears in the ideal.

 -canon [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Sort variables, generators and ideals to get canonical representation.

 -deform [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Apply a generic deformation to the input ideal.

 -iformat STRING   (default is autodetect)
   The format used to read the input. This action supports the formats:
     4ti2 cocoa4 m2 monos newmonos null singular.
   The format "autodetect" instructs Frobby to guess the format.
   Type 'frobby help io' for more information on input formats.

 -minimize [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Remove non-minimial generators.

 -oformat STRING   (default is input)
   The format used to write the output. This action supports the formats:
     4ti2 cocoa4 count m2 monos newmonos null singular.
   The format "input" instructs Frobby to use the input format.
   Type 'frobby help io' for more information on output formats.

 -product [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Replace each ideal with the product of its generators.

 -projectVar INTEGER   (default is 0)
   Project away the i'th variable counting from 1. No action is taken for a
   value of 0 or more than the number of variables in the ring.

 -radical [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Take the radical of the generators. Combine this with -minimize to
   get rid of any non-minimal ones.

 -sort [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Sort generators according to the reverse lexicographic order.

 -time [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Display and time each subcomputation.

 -unique [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Remove duplicate generators.
