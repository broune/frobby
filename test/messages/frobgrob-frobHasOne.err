NOTE: The action frobgrob is DEPRECATED, and will be removed in a future
release of Frobby. Use the action optimize with options -chopFirstAndSubtract
and -maxStandard instead to get the same effect.
NOTE: The split selection strategy "frob" is deprecated and will be removed in
a future version of Frobby. Use the name "degree" to achieve the same thing.
SYNTAX ERROR (line 1):
  Read the number 1 while reading Frobenius instance. Only integers strictly
  larger than 1 are valid.
