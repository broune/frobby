Displaying information on action: analyze

Display information about input ideal. This is useful for getting a quick
impression of how the ideal looks like, and it can be used in scripts
that need information about the ideal.

The parameters accepted by analyze are as follows.

 -genCount [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Print the number of generators.

 -iformat STRING   (default is autodetect)
   The format used to read the input. This action supports the formats:
     4ti2 cocoa4 m2 monos newmonos null singular.
   The format "autodetect" instructs Frobby to guess the format.
   Type 'frobby help io' for more information on input formats.

 -lcm [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Print the least common multiple of the generators.

 -maxExp [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Print the largest exponent that appears in the input file

 -minimal [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Print 1 if the ideal has no non-minimal generators. Print 0 otherwise.

 -oformat STRING   (default is input)
   The format used to write the output. This action supports the formats:
     4ti2 cocoa4 count m2 monos newmonos null singular.
   The format "input" instructs Frobby to use the input format.
   Type 'frobby help io' for more information on output formats.

 -summaryLevel INTEGER   (default is 1)
   If non-zero, then print a summary of the ideal to the error output
   stream. A higher summary level results in more expensive analysis in
   order to provide more information. Currently levels 0, 1 and 2 are
   available.

 -time [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Display and time each subcomputation.

 -varCount [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Print the number of variables.
