Displaying information on action: dimension

Compute the dimension or codimension of the input ideal. This is the
dimension of the zero set of the ideal. The ideal containing the identity
has an empty zero set, and we define the dimension of this to be -1.
All other ideals have non-negative dimension.

The parameters accepted by dimension are as follows.

 -codim [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Compute the codimension instead of the dimension. The codimension is the
   number of variables in the polynomial ring minus the dimension.

 -iformat STRING   (default is autodetect)
   The format used to read the input. This action supports the formats:
     4ti2 cocoa4 m2 monos newmonos null singular.
   The format "autodetect" instructs Frobby to guess the format.
   Type 'frobby help io' for more information on input formats.

 -squareFreeAndMinimal [BOOL]   (default is off)
   State that the input ideal is square free and minimally generated. This
   can speed up the the computation, but will result in unpredictable
   behavior if it is not true.

 -time [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Display and time each subcomputation.

 -useSlice [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Use the Slice Algorithm to compute the dimension instead of the usual
   algorithm.
