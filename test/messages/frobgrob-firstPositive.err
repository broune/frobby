NOTE: The action frobgrob is DEPRECATED, and will be removed in a future
release of Frobby. Use the action optimize with options -chopFirstAndSubtract
and -maxStandard instead to get the same effect.
NOTE: The split selection strategy "frob" is deprecated and will be removed in
a future version of Frobby. Use the name "degree" to achieve the same thing.
ERROR: Encountered positive entry as first entry in term. This is impossible if
using the required degree reverse lexicographic term order.
