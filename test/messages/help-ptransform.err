Displaying information on action: ptransform

By default, transform simply writes the input polynomial to output. A
number of parameters allow to transform the input polynomial in various ways.

The parameters accepted by ptransform are as follows.

 -canon [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Sort variables and generators to get a canonical representation.

 -iformat STRING   (default is autodetect)
   The format used to read the input. This action supports the formats:
     4ti2 cocoa4 m2 null singular.
   The format "autodetect" instructs Frobby to guess the format.
   Type 'frobby help io' for more information on input formats.

 -oformat STRING   (default is input)
   The format used to write the output. This action supports the formats:
     4ti2 cocoa4 count m2 null singular.
   The format "input" instructs Frobby to use the input format.
   Type 'frobby help io' for more information on output formats.

 -sort [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Sort the terms.

 -time [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Display and time each subcomputation.
