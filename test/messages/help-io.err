Frobby understands several file formats. These are not documented, but they are
simple enough that seeing an example should be enough to figure them out.
Getting an example is as simple as making Frobby produce output in that format.

It is true of all the formats that white-space is insignificant, but other than
that Frobby is quite fuzzy about how the input must look. E.g. a Macaulay 2
file containing a monomial ideal must start with "R = ", so writing "r = " with
a lower-case r is an error. To help with this, Frobby tries to say what is
wrong if there is an error.

If no input format is specified, Frobby will guess at the format, and it will
guess correctly if there are no errors in the input. If no output format is
specified, Frobby will use the same format for output as for input. If you want
to force Frobby to use a specific format, use the -iformat and -oformat
options. Using these with the transform action allows translation between
formats.

The formats available in Frobby and the types of data they support are as
follows.

* The format 4ti2: Format used by the software package 4ti2.
  - supports input and output of a monomial ideal.
  - supports input and output of a list of monomial ideals.
  - supports input and output of a polynomial.
  - supports input of a saturated binomial ideal.

* The format cocoa4: Format understandable by the program CoCoA 4.
  - supports input and output of a monomial ideal.
  - supports input of a list of monomial ideals.
  - supports input and output of a polynomial.

* The format count: Writes the number of output terms.
  - supports output of a monomial ideal.
  - supports output of a list of monomial ideals.
  - supports output of a polynomial.

* The format m2: Format understandable by the program Macaulay 2.
  - supports input and output of a monomial ideal.
  - supports input and output of a list of monomial ideals.
  - supports input and output of a polynomial.

* The format monos: Older format used by the program Monos.
  - supports input and output of a monomial ideal.
  - supports input and output of a list of monomial ideals.

* The format newmonos: Newer format used by the program Monos.
