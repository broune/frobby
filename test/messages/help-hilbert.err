Displaying information on action: hilbert

Compute the multigraded Hilbert-Poincare series of the input
ideal. Use the -univariate option to get the univariate series.

The Hilbert-Poincare series of a monomial ideal is the sum of all
monomials not in the ideal. This sum can be written as a (finite)
rational function with (x1-1)(x2-1)...(xn-1) in the denominator,
assuming the variables of the ring are x1,x2,...,xn. This action
computes the polynomial in the numerator of this fraction.

The parameters accepted by hilbert are as follows.

 -algorithm STRING   (default is bigatti)
   Which algorithm to use. Options are slice, bigatti and deform.

 -canon [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Sort the output, including the variables, to get a canonical
   representation. This requires storing the entire output in memory, which
   can increase run time modestly and increase memory consumption greatly.
   The impact for the Bigatti et.al. algorithm is much less than for the
   Slice Algorithm since the Bigatti et.al. algorithm always has to
   store the entire output in memory regardless of this option.

 -debug [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Print what the algorithm does at each step. Slice algorithm only.

 -deformStrong [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Deform to a strongly generic ideal if true. Otherwise deform to a weakly
   generic ideal.

 -deformationOrder STRING   (default is tdeg_lex)
   The deformation order used for the deformation algorithm.

 -enum STRING   (default is revlex)
   The enumeration order used for the deformation algorithm.

 -genericBase [BOOL]   (default is on)
   Detect generic ideals as a base case of the Bigatti algorithm.

 -iformat STRING   (default is autodetect)
   The format used to read the input. This action supports the formats:
     4ti2 cocoa4 m2 monos newmonos null singular.
   The format "autodetect" instructs Frobby to guess the format.
   Type 'frobby help io' for more information on input formats.

 -independence [BOOL]   (default is on)
   Perform independence splits when possible. Slice algorithm only.

 -minimal [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Specifies that the input ideal is minimally generated by the given
   generators. Turning this on can improve performance, but if it is not
   true then Frobby may go into an infinite loop or produce incorrect results.
   Slice algorithm only.

 -oformat STRING   (default is input)
   The format used to write the output. This action supports the formats:
     4ti2 cocoa4 count m2 null singular.
   The format "input" instructs Frobby to use the input format.
   Type 'frobby help io' for more information on output formats.

 -simplify [BOOL]   (default is on)
   Perform simplification when possible.

 -split STRING   (default is median)
   The split selection strategy to use. Slice options are maxlabel, minlabel,
   varlabel, minimum, median, maximum, mingen, indep and gcd. Optimization
   computations support the specialized strategy degree as well.
   Bigatti et.al. options are median, mostNGPure, mostNGGcd,
   mostNGTight, typicalPure, typicalGcd, typicalTight, typicalNGPure,
   typicalNGGcd, typicalNGTight, someNGPure, someNGGcd and someNGTight.

 -stats [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Print statistics on what the algorithm did. Slice algorithm only.

 -time [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Display and time each subcomputation.

 -univariate [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Output a univariate polynomial by substituting t for each variable.

 -widenPivot [BOOL]   (default is on)
   Widen selected pivots when performing pivot splits.
   Bigatti et.al. algorithm only.
