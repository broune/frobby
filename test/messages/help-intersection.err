Displaying information on action: intersection

Computes the intersection of the input ideals. Simply concatenate the textual
representations of the ideals in order to intersect them.

Note that this operation is currently implemented in a rather slow way.

The parameters accepted by intersection are as follows.

 -canon [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Sort the generators and variables to get a canonical output.

 -iformat STRING   (default is autodetect)
   The format used to read the input. This action supports the formats:
     4ti2 cocoa4 m2 monos newmonos null singular.
   The format "autodetect" instructs Frobby to guess the format.
   Type 'frobby help io' for more information on input formats.

 -oformat STRING   (default is input)
   The format used to write the output. This action supports the formats:
     4ti2 cocoa4 count m2 monos newmonos null singular.
   The format "input" instructs Frobby to use the input format.
   Type 'frobby help io' for more information on output formats.

 -time [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Display and time each subcomputation.
