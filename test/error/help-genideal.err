Displaying information on action: genideal

Generate a monomial ideal. The default is to generate a random one,
and in certain rare cases the generated ideal may have less than the requested
number of minimial generators. This can be alleviated by increasing the
exponent range or the number of variables.

The other types of ideals are not random, and they use the number of variables
as a parameter and may thus have more generators, depending on the type.

The parameters accepted by genideal are as follows.

 -time [BOOL]   (default is off)
   Display and time each subcomputation.

 -oformat STRING   (default is m2)
   The format used to write the output. This action supports the formats:
     m2 cocoa4 singular monos newmonos 4ti2 null count.
   Type 'frobby help io' for more information on output formats.

 -expRange INTEGER   (default is 9)
   Exponents are chosen uniformly in the range [0,INTEGER].

 -varCount INTEGER   (default is 3)
   The number of variables.

 -genCount INTEGER   (default is 5)
   The number of minimal generators.

 -type STRING   (default is random)
   The supported types of ideals are random, edge, list, king and knight.
