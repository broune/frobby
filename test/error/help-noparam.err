Frobby performs a number of computations related to monomial ideals. You
run it by typing `frobby ACTION', where ACTION is one of the following.

 hilbert      - Compute the Hilbert-Poincare series of the input ideal.
 irrdecom     - Compute the irreducible decomposition of the input ideal.
 primdecom    - Compute the primary decomposition of monomial ideals.
 alexdual     - Compute the Alexander dual of the input ideal.
 assoprimes   - Compute the associated primes of the input ideal.
 maxstandard  - Compute the maximal standard monomials of the input ideal.
 dimension    - Compute the (co)dimension of the input ideal.
 optimize     - Solve optimization problems related to the input ideal.
 transform    - Change the representation of the input ideal.
 ptransform   - Change the representation of the input polynomial.
 intersection - Intersect the input ideals.
 genideal     - Generate a random monomial ideal.
 frobdyn      - Compute Frobenius number using dynamic programming.
 genfrob      - Generate a random Frobenius problem instance.
 analyze      - Display information about the input ideal.
 latformat    - Change the representation of the input lattice.

Type 'frobby help ACTION' to get more details on a specific action.
Note that all input and output is done via the standard streams.
Type 'frobby help io' for more information on input and output formats.
