Frobby understands several file formats. These are not documented,
but they are simple enough that seeing an example should be enough
to figure them out. Getting an example is as simple as making
Frobby produce output in that format.

It is true of all the formats that white-space is insignificant,
but other than that Frobby is quite fuzzy about how the input
must look. E.g. a Macaulay 2 file containing a monomial ideal
must start with "R = ", so writing "r = " with a lower-case r
is an error. To help with this, Frobby tries to say what is wrong
if there is an error.

If no input format is specified, Frobby will guess at the format,
and it will guess correctly if there are no errors in the input.
If no output format is specified, Frobby will use the same format
for output as for input. If you want to force Frobby to use a
specific format, use the -iformat and -oformat options. Using
these with the transform action allows translation between formats.

The formats available in Frobby and the types of data they
support are as follows.

* The format m2: Format understandable by the program Macaulay 2.
  - supports input and output of a monomial ideal.
  - supports input and output of a list of monomial ideals.
  - supports input and output of a polynomial.

* The format cocoa4: Format understandable by the program CoCoA 4.
  - supports input and output of a monomial ideal.
  - supports input of a list of monomial ideals.
  - supports input and output of a polynomial.

* The format singular: Format understandable by the program Singular.
  - supports input and output of a monomial ideal.
  - supports input of a list of monomial ideals.
  - supports input and output of a polynomial.

* The format monos: Older format used by the program Monos.
  - supports input and output of a monomial ideal.
  - supports input and output of a list of monomial ideals.

* The format newmonos: Newer format used by the program Monos.
  - supports input and output of a monomial ideal.
  - supports input of a list of monomial ideals.

* The format 4ti2: Format used by the software package 4ti2.
  - supports input and output of a monomial ideal.
  - supports input and output of a list of monomial ideals.
  - supports input and output of a polynomial.

* The format null: Ignores input and produces no output.
  - supports input and output of a monomial ideal.
  - supports input and output of a list of monomial ideals.
  - supports input and output of a polynomial.

* The format count: Writes the number of output terms.
  - supports output of a monomial ideal.
  - supports output of a list of monomial ideals.
  - supports output of a polynomial.
