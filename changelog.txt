*** Version 0.8.0, 2009-02-12

This version adds support for

 - Hilbert-Poincare series.
 - Primary decomposition.
 - Maximal standard monomials.
 - Linear optimization problems over monomial ideals.
 - The format cocoa4 that can be processed by CoCoA 4.
 - The format singular, which can be processed by Singular.
 - Manipulation of polynomials for formats where it makes sense.

The library interface is expanded and is now tested in the
testsuite. This interface is being used by Macaulay 2 and CoCoA to
perform some of their computations on monomial ideals. The library
interface, and Frobby in general, is now exception-safe and deals
gracefully with running out of memory. Frobby is also included with
Sage as an optional package.

The testsuite for every functionality has been greatly extended and
improved, with the consequence that the tests now take much longer to
run, as they are testing many more aspects of Frobby and there is more
testing going on.

Having Frobby included with Macaulay 2 and CoCoA has resulted in a
number of improvements to make Frobby build correctly on the many
platforms that these systems support. Thanks goes to Daniel R. Grayson,
Michael Stillman and Anna Bigatti for their work on this.
