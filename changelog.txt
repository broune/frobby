*** Upcoming version

 - The action frobgrob is deprecated and will be removed in a future
   version of Frobby. Use the action optimize with options
   chopFirstAndSubtract and maxStandard to achieve the same effect.

 - The split selection strategy named frob is now deprecated and will
   be removed in a future version of Frobby. Use the name degree to
   achieve the same effect.

 - The bound optimization has at some point been made inaccessible by
   mistake, so that even if the option -bound was turned on for
   actions frobgrob and optimize, as it is by default, it made no
   difference. This is corrected, which should yield substantial
   performance improvements for the actions frobgrob and optimize.

 - Frobby now refuses to use independence splits when solving
   Frobenius problems and other optimization problems. They were never
   implemented for that case, which has now been exposed by enabling
   the bound optimization.

 - The design for how internal C++ tests are done is much improved and
   the number of tests bas been expanded substantially.

 - Code file dependency tracking is much improved. It is now fully automatic,
   so the Makefile target depend is removed.

 - Improved the pure power split selection strategies to choose a
   middle variable in case of ties instead of the left-most
   variable. This makes no difference for most inputs, but leads to
   dramatic speed-ups for some particular highly non-generic inputs.

 - The amount of information in the developer documentation, which is
   generated based on source code comments, has increased
   substantially.

*** Version 0.8.1, 2009-04-30

This is a minor update.

 - There is now a manual in doc/manual.tex.
 - Frobby no longer crashes when using the -stats and -debug options.
 - The developer documentation can now be built on Cygwin.
 - The example/ directory is now named liraryTest/ to avoid confusion.
 - The Makefile now has an "install" target.

*** Version 0.8.0, 2009-02-12

This version adds support for

 - Hilbert-Poincare series.
 - Primary decomposition.
 - Maximal standard monomials.
 - Linear optimization problems over monomial ideals.
 - The format cocoa4 that can be processed by CoCoA 4.
 - The format singular, which can be processed by Singular.
 - Manipulation of polynomials for formats where it makes sense.

The library interface is expanded and is now tested in the
testsuite. This interface is being used by Macaulay 2 and CoCoA to
perform some of their computations on monomial ideals. The library
interface, and Frobby in general, is now exception-safe and deals
gracefully with running out of memory. Frobby is also included with
Sage as an optional package.

The testsuite for every functionality has been greatly extended and
improved, with the consequence that the tests now take much longer to
run, as they are testing many more aspects of Frobby and there is more
testing going on.

Having Frobby included with Macaulay 2 and CoCoA has resulted in a
number of improvements to make Frobby build correctly on the many
platforms that these systems support. Thanks goes to Daniel R. Grayson,
Michael Stillman and Anna Bigatti for their work on this.
